Deployment – Publish the dashboard to Power BI Service for stakeholders.
. Insights from the Dashboard
YTD Sales show a steady upward trend, with a noticeable spike in Q2 due to seasonal promotions.

SUVs contribute the largest share of total sales by body style.

White and Black cars dominate color preferences.

Region A consistently outperforms other dealer regions in both sales amount and units sold.

Average selling price has increased YOY, suggesting stronger pricing power or higher demand for premium models.
